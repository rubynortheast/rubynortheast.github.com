# Ruby North East Website

This is the repository for [rubynortheast.com](rubynortheast.com).

Following [the fall-out] [1] around [ruby-lang.org](http://www.ruby-lang.org), it is suggested that we [follow their example] [2] by going for a *static* site. This means it it trivial for anyone in the group, regardless of skill-level, to contribute and has the added benefit that it can be hosted easily on github pages.

Dynamic functionality can easily be added using JavaScript, with flat .json files for storing data to be pulled in. If things develop to the point where a server-side solution is needed this can then be discussed.
