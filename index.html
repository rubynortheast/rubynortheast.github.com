                  Experienced, North East based, Linux System Administrator and open source advocate, Andrew Taylor (<a href="http://twitter.com/ukandrewtaylor">@ukandrewtaylor</a>) will be talking all things Cloud at <em>Ruby North East</em> on Tuesday. Coming off the back of a very well received talk on Background Job Processing with Beanstalkd at <a href="http://phpne.org.uk/2012/11/05/november-using-beanstalkd-to-spread-the-work-of-your-php-application/">PHP North East</a> we are delighted to secure him for this month’s event. Andrew was recently snapped up by local FTSE 100 software giants, Sage (UK) Ltd., to help them in their global expansion into cloud hosted SaaS applications using Ruby and the Rails framework.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Previous talks have focused specifically on specialised Ruby cloud vendors such as Heroku and EngineYard, but Andrew will be approaching this topic from a System Administrator’s perspective. This makes it relevant to developers from any language or framework interested in hosting their applications in the cloud. This is a technical talk and will cover:
                </p>
                <p>
                  - What is the cloud?<br>
                  - Cloud types and vendors compared<br>
                  - Amazon Web Services as an example of available features<br>
                  - Application design and architecture concerns<br>
                </p>

             Object Oriented Design in Ruby (with Rails)
           </strong>
           <br>
           Rails is the victim of its own success. As applications grow larger and more complex, the promise of "sustainable productivity" evapourates. Learn how the Rails community is embracing Object Oriented Design to better architect maintainable software. Data-Context-Interaction (DCI) and SOLID will be presented as complements to Model-View-Controller (MVC). Although discussing Ruby and Rails, the principles will apply to other frameworks and languages.</p> <p>All are welcome. Philip Poots and Stephen Lloyd-Hirst present on Tuesday 29th May at 7pm at The Old Post Office, Pink Lane, Newcastle upon Tyne. <a href="http://rubynortheast-may12.eventbrite.com/">Register with Eventbrite</a>.
